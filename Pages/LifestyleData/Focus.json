            "What Is the 90/20 Rule?": "The 90/20 rule is a time management and energy optimization method that encourages people to work in 90-minute cycles of deep focus, followed by a 20-minute break. This rhythm is based on the body’s ultradian cycles, which naturally influence alertness and energy levels throughout the day. By respecting this rhythm, you can maintain sustained concentration, maximize mental clarity, and avoid exhaustion that comes from pushing yourself without rest.",
            "Why 90 Minutes of Work?": "Studies in neuroscience and productivity research show that the human brain can sustain peak focus and productivity for approximately 90 minutes before its efficiency starts to decline. Beyond this point, concentration begins to drop, errors increase, and the quality of work decreases. The 90-minute work block allows you to fully immerse yourself in one meaningful task without interruptions, while still staying within the brain’s natural capacity for deep work. This period is long enough to achieve significant progress, yet short enough to prevent burnout.",
            "The Science Behind Breaks": [
                "Breaks are essential to restore energy and prevent mental fatigue. When you step away after 90 minutes of focus, the brain gets a chance to recover and consolidate what you’ve just worked on.",
                "The 20-minute break length is ideal because it’s long enough for your body and mind to relax, but not so long that you lose momentum or motivation.",
                "Short breaks help improve creativity, boost memory retention, and maintain overall productivity throughout the day. Without breaks, stress builds up and focus diminishes, leading to burnout."

            "How to Apply the Rule Effectively": {
                "Plan": "Before starting your 90-minute session, clearly define the single most important task you’ll focus on. Having clarity prevents wasted time and keeps your mind aligned on one goal.",

                "Break Wisely": "When the timer ends, step away from your work. Use the 20 minutes to stretch, hydrate, meditate, or take a short walk. Avoid social media or activities that can pull you into longer distractions.",
                "Repeat": "Ideally, repeat this cycle 2–3 times in a workday. This helps you stay productive while keeping your energy balanced. Over time, it also trains your brain to enter ‘deep work mode’ faster and with greater ease."

Even a short walk can help reduce mental fatigue and increase alertness, making it easier to return to tasks with renewed focus.",

Exposure to natural light also supports better sleep cycles, which in turn boosts overall productivity and well-being.",
            "Why Disconnecting From Devices Matters": "Walking without your phone allows you to fully immerse yourself in the present moment.
