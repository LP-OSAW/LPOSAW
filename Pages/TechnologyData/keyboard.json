    "What Are Keyboard Shortcuts?": "Keyboard shortcuts are combinations of keys that perform specific functions within software or an operating system without the need for mouse input. They are designed to streamline workflow, reduce repetitive actions, and enhance user efficiency by providing quick access to commands.",

By reducing dependency on the mouse, users can keep their hands on the keyboard, enabling faster execution of commands like copying, pasting, switching between windows, or formatting text. Studies show that proficient use of shortcuts can significantly cut down work time in both casual and professional environments.",
