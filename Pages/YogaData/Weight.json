            "Understanding How Yoga Aids in Weight Loss": "Yoga supports weight loss by increasing physical activity, improving metabolism, reducing stress-related eating, and enhancing self-awareness. Unlike intense cardio, yoga works holistically—toning muscles, stimulating internal organs, and balancing hormones to promote sustainable fat loss.",
